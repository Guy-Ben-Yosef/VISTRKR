# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, we have not yet published any versions of our software. However, we are actively working on developing and testing our software, and we plan to release the first version in the near future.

Once we have released the first version, we will provide information on which versions of the software are currently supported, including any end-of-life dates for older versions. We will also provide guidance on upgrading to newer versions and any backward compatibility issues that may arise.

We are committed to providing a stable and secure software product, and we will continue to release new versions that address security vulnerabilities and improve the functionality of our software. Stay tuned for updates on our release schedule and supported versions.
